# SYNOPSIS:
#
# Gathers info about current system, creates environment variables for
# use in conditional scripting
#
# --------------------------------------------
# DETAILS
# Presently, this sets the following ENV vars to one of the given values:
#
# * PLATFORM = whatever `uname -s` prints out, uppercased.
# * DISTRO = one of { ARCH, DEBIAN, REDHAT, UNKNOWN }
#
# NB:
# In particular the latter is a bit of a misnomer, it's really better stated as
# being the package-manager of note for those systems. It operates entirely by 
# checking to see if the package manager for that distro-family exists. Eventually
# it would be ideal to have this have more detail, perhaps existing as some
# structured format which some functions could deal with. 
# 
# I also imagine this information exists consistently somewhere else, but it's 
# nice to have it all tied up in a bash script.

# Gather platform information (OSX? Linux? etc)
export PLATFORM="$(uname -s | tr a-z A-Z)"

# Gather distro information for linux 
if [ "$PLATFORM" = "LINUX" ] ; then
  if which pacman &>/dev/null ; then
    export DISTRO=ARCH
  elif which apt-get &>/dev/null ; then
    # figure out which debian clone it is, might be valuable to distinguish...
    export DISTRO=DEBIAN
  elif which yum &>/dev/null ; then
    export DISTRO=REDHAT
  else
    export DISTRO=UNKOWN
