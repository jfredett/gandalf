# Why is this directory here?

Everything in this directory is gitignored, so you can place stuff like secret
API keys, etc here w/o having to worry about accidentally uploading them.
Distributing these to be in sync across machines is not something Gandalf tries
to solve, though you might try something like Bittorrent sync to do it.

## Examples of stuff that might go here

* AWS Secret Keys
* Homebrew token
* Github token
